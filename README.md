# Frontend development (Angular) Workshop

This project is part of a Workshop for a client.
The development teams consist mostly of Java backend developers, but the focus of development is shifting towards web apps.
The goal is to give the necessary tools to start playing around with web apps.

The workshop will be given a curriculum to study independently, consisting of the most important concepts:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript / TypeScript

By using Supabase as a free hosted DB + API and Netlify for free deployment & hosting, they can start with a simple app that can be used in daily life.
I believe that having a working app that can be shared with friends/family and compared with colleagues is the best way to spark interest in web development.
The idea is to give simple instructions and the freedom to customize the styling and features as they see fit.

This repo was purely used for screenshots and as a tool to write out the instruction steps of the workshop.
